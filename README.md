# Next Chat App
This application was created with nextjs and for query we use rtk query. \
The application is not fully ready. Cause in this version 2 we just add a json-server. \
In the next update we will add our own server with Laravel or Express js.

## Installation
First clone the project to your machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/limon-btcz/next_chat_app.git
```

Go to the cloned project directory
```bash
cd next-chat-app
```

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

finally start the local server,
```bash
npm run dev
```
Application will run on http://localhost:4000 \
you can change port from pacage.json file.


Now visit http://localhost:4000 to explore the next-chat-app. Demo user data was given in the db.json which was in server folder. all user password is set to "454545".

##Server
Don't forget to run the server. You can run the server by the server directory.
